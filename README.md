# Chesstats.

Chesstats is a data analysis tool that helps you visualize and understand different aspects of your chess games. Right now, it works using PGN files, containing the information of different chess games from one or more users. The PGN file can be uploaded or retrived from Chess.com. The tool consists of an interactive dashboard that guides you through all the different stats of the games.
